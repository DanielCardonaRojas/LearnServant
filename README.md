# Learning Servant

Servant seems to be one of the most popular and advanced web frameworks for Haskell.
It uses very advanced GHC extensions and type wizardry. But can do things such as create 
documentation for a web api, create client functions and more.

The purpose of this repo is just to learn the basics of Servant, and explore its capabilities.
